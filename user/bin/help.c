        "FAQ",
        "Frequently Asked Questions\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: What hardware does VibeOS run on?\n"
        "A: VibeOS runs on QEMU's virt machine (aarch64) and Raspberry Pi\n"
        "   Zero 2W. QEMU is the primary development platform.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Can I run Linux programs on VibeOS?\n"
        "A: No. VibeOS is not Linux-compatible. Programs must be compiled\n"
        "   specifically for VibeOS using the VibeOS API.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Is VibeOS POSIX-compliant?\n"
        "A: No. VibeOS has a POSIX-like shell and some POSIX-like APIs,\n"
        "   but it's not a full POSIX system.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Does VibeOS have memory protection?\n"
        "A: No. VibeOS uses a flat memory model with no MMU. All code runs\n"
        "   in kernel space. Think Windows 3.1, not modern OSes.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: How does multitasking work?\n"
        "A: Cooperative multitasking. Programs call yield() to give up the\n"
        "   CPU. The scheduler uses round-robin scheduling.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Can I add more RAM?\n"
        "A: In QEMU, yes. Use -m flag: qemu-system-aarch64 -m 512M ...\n"
        "   VibeOS detects RAM size from the device tree at boot.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Why 1-bit black & white graphics?\n"
        "A: Aesthetic choice. VibeOS aims for retro Mac System 7 vibes.\n"
        "   The framebuffer is actually 32-bit color, but we only use\n"
        "   black (0x00000000) and white (0x00FFFFFF).\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Can I connect to WiFi?\n"
        "A: Not currently. VibeOS has Ethernet networking via virtio-net\n"
        "   in QEMU. WiFi drivers are not implemented.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: How do I transfer files to/from VibeOS?\n"
        "A: Mount disk.img on your host OS (macOS: hdiutil attach disk.img)\n"
        "   and copy files. Unmount before running QEMU.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Can I port X to VibeOS?\n"
        "A: Maybe! If X is written in C and doesn't require POSIX-specific\n"
        "   features, you can try porting it. Start with small programs.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Where's the source code?\n"
        "A: VibeOS is a hobby project. The entire OS source is in the\n"
        "   /kernel and /user directories.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Why does DOOM run at 35 FPS?\n"
        "A: DOOM's internal timer is tied to a 35Hz tic rate. That's the\n"
        "   original game's design, not a VibeOS limitation.\n"
        "\n"
        "Q: Can I write GUI apps in Python?\n"
        "A: Yes! See the Python API section. The browser is written in\n"
        "   Python as a demonstration.\n"
